## Introduction

The GINPA protocol aims to address the limitations of existing internet protocols by introducing a new architecture that optimizes data transmission, reduces latency, and enhances security. By combining the flexibility of GDScript with the performance of Rust, GINPA offers a versatile and powerful solution for modern internet applications.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Transmission**: Optimized algorithms for faster data exchange.
- **Enhanced Security**: Advanced encryption and authentication mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with various operating systems and devices.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize for different use cases.

## Installation

To get started with the GINPA protocol, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Godot Engine (install from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/))

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/skygenesisenterprise/ginpa.git
   cd ginpa
   ```

2. **Build the Rust project:**

   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Set up the GDScript environment:**

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y godot
   ```

4. **Build the GDScript project:**

   ```sh
   godot --export "Linux/X11" ./build/ginpa.x86_64
   ```

## Usage

To use the GINPA protocol, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Rust server:**

   ```sh
   cargo run --release
   ```

2. **Run the GDScript client:**

   ```sh
   godot --run ./path/to/your/gdscript/project
   ```
